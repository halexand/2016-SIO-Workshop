Using and Installing Circos
======================================


The goals of this tutorial are to:

*  install circos on your Ubuntu AWS system 
*  use circos to visualize our data **fill me in with something itneresting**

Note: Beyond this brief introduction, circos is very well-documented and has a great series of `tutorials  <http://circos.ca/documentation/tutorials/>` and `course <http://circos.ca/documentation/course/>` materials that are useful. 

Installing Circos
==================================================

Within your Amazon instance make a directory called circos and navigate into it. Next, we will download the latest version of circos and extract it: 
::
    mkdir circos
    cd circos
    wget http://circos.ca/distribution/circos-0.69-3.tgz 
    tar -xvzf circos-0.69-3.tgz
